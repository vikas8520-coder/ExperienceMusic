Got it — those images are basically **cymatics / Chladni-style resonance patterns**: “sound syncing with matter” where certain frequencies create **stable standing-wave nodes** and the particles/liquid collect into those shapes.

Here’s a practical way to add **presets like that** in your app, without needing a full physics simulation (but still *feels* physically grounded).

---

## The visual language you want

To sell “natural resonant frequency,” your presets should show 3 things clearly:

1. **Standing waves** (stable, symmetric node lines)
2. **Matter accumulation** (sand/grains/particles collect on nodes)
3. **Mode changes** (pattern “snaps” into a new geometry when frequency shifts)

So your visuals should **not** just wiggle; they should **lock into patterns**.

## Preset pack: “Resonance” (like your images)

### Preset 01 — **Cymatic Sand Plate**

**Look:** like the purple granular pattern (top image).
**Mechanic:** render a “plate” height field (standing wave) + advect grains toward nodes.

**Audio mapping**

* `fundamentalFreq (dominant peak)` → selects a **mode** (pattern family)
* `bass energy` → overall vibration intensity (grain movement)
* `high energy` → grain sparkle / micro jitter
* `kick` → brief “burst” that pushes grains then they settle back into nodes

**What makes it feel real**

* Grains **migrate and settle**, not just shimmer.
* Pattern changes are **quantized** (snap between modes) rather than continuous mush.

---

### Preset 02 — **Water Membrane Orb**

**Look:** like the blue circular fluid resonance (bottom image).
**Mechanic:** spherical/round membrane standing wave + refraction + caustic-like highlights.

**Audio mapping**

* `mid energy` → membrane deformation amount
* `dominantFreq` → rotation of nodal structure / number of lobes
* `sub` → slow “breathing pressure”
* `highs` → glints/caustic flicker

**What makes it feel real**

* “Nodes” stay relatively stable; amplitude changes thicken/thin the ridges.
* Highlights move like light on liquid, not like noise.

---

### Preset 03 — **Chladni Geometry**

**Look:** clean sacred-geometry style node lines (very “Apple but psych”).
**Mechanic:** 2D mode shapes (Bessel/sine combinations) projected onto a disk/plate.

**Audio mapping**

* `dominantFreq` → integers `(m, n)` controlling mode shape
* `bass` → thickness of node lines
* `mids` → secondary perturbation (subtle)
* `highs` → edge shimmer / micro particles

**What makes it feel real**

* Modes are **integer-based** (like real resonance modes).
  Example: as dominant frequency rises, pattern steps through (2,1) → (3,1) → (4,2)…

---

### Preset 04 — **Resonant Field Lines**

**Look:** magnetic-field style curves that “organize” into symmetric lattices.
**Mechanic:** vector field aligned to standing-wave gradient; particles flow then stabilize.

**Audio mapping**

* `sub/bass` → field strength
* `dominantFreq` → symmetry count
* `highs` → filament noise

**What makes it feel real**

* Field lines converge toward stable attractors (nodes).

---

## The real trick: “dominant frequency → mode selection”

Instead of using raw FFT bands only, compute **dominant peak frequency** each frame:

* Do FFT → find strongest peak (or top 2 peaks)
* Smooth it (so it doesn’t jump wildly)
* Map it into a “mode index”:

Example:

* 80–120 Hz → Mode 1
* 120–180 Hz → Mode 2
* 180–260 Hz → Mode 3
  …and so on

This is what creates that **“resonance snap”** effect.

## Implementation strategy (fast + high quality)

### Option A (recommended): **Procedural cymatics shader + particle “matter” layer**

You do **two passes**:

**Pass 1: Standing-wave field (shader)**

* Create a scalar field `F(x,y)` where `F=0` are node lines.
* Visualize node lines + ridges with smoothstep contours.

**Pass 2: Matter accumulation**

* Render particles/grains
* Each frame, apply a force that pulls grains toward the node set:

  * `force = -sign(F) * normalize(∇F)` (moves particles toward F=0)
* Add damping so they “settle”

This looks extremely close to cymatics without heavy fluid sim.

### Option B: Full fluid sim

Looks amazing but expensive + complex, especially on mobile. You can add later.

## Concrete “preset parameters” you can store

Each preset can be a JSON config like:

* `shape`: `"plate" | "disk" | "sphere"`
* `modeSet`: list of (m,n) or symmetry integers
* `nodeSharpness`: how crisp the lines are
* `matterDensity`: particle count / grain size
* `settleSpeed`: how quickly matter settles into nodes
* `burstOnKick`: how strong the kick pushes matter away
* `palette`: (purple sand / icy blue liquid)
* `post`: bloom, chromatic aberration (subtle)

This makes your “preset system” clean and scalable.

## How to make it “feel natural” (non-negotiables)

If you do these 4, it will read as real resonance:

1. **Quantize mode switching** (don’t continuously morph shapes)
2. **Matter drifts + settles** (particles move into the lines)
3. **Amplitude affects thickness/intensity**, not the topology
4. **Kick causes a temporary disruption**, then pattern re-stabilizes

---

## Quick direction for your tech stack

Since you’ve been working with **React + R3F + @react-three/postprocessing**, you can implement this as:

* Fullscreen plane with a **custom shader material** (field + contours)
* Particle system (instanced points) updated on CPU or GPU
* Postprocessing: Bloom + slight Chromatic Aberration + Noise

---

## Next: I can give you working code

Tell me which platform you’re building this preset system on:

1. **React + Three.js / R3F (web)**
2. **React Native / Expo GL**
3. Something else

And tell me how you’re playing audio:

* `<audio>` element?
* WebAudio buffer?
* streaming?

Once you say “R3F + audio element” (or similar), I’ll paste a ready-to-run component:

* analyser → dominant frequency + bands
* mode quantization
* cymatics shader plane
* “sand” particles that accumulate on nodes
* kick burst + settle

That will get you *exactly* the vibe in your screenshots.
