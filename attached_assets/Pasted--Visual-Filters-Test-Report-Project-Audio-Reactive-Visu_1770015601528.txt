🎛️ Visual Filters Test Report

Project: Audio-Reactive Visual App
Tester: You
Date: Current iteration
Context: Testing image/thumbnail-based visual filters reacting to music

1️⃣ RGB Split Filter
✅ What’s working well

The RGB channel separation effect itself is strong

Color displacement feels psychedelic and alive

Works well as a high-frequency / shimmer-reactive effect

Adds good perceived motion without heavy geometry changes

⚠️ Issue observed

A mirrored / bounced version of the original image is visible in the background

This breaks immersion:

Feels like a technical artifact rather than a creative choice

Pulls attention away from the main subject

The background reflection becomes noticeable during movement peaks

🔍 Likely cause (technical)

Texture wrapping or UV mirroring (RepeatWrapping / MirroredRepeatWrapping)

RGB offset sampling outside UV bounds

Feedback or post-process buffer bleeding into background

🔧 Recommended improvements

Clamp instead of mirror

Clamp UVs so RGB channels do not sample outside the image

Edge fade / vignette mask

Gradually fade RGB displacement near edges

Depth-aware split

Stronger RGB split near center, weaker near edges

Optional background treatment

Replace mirror with:

soft blur

darkened static background

subtle grain/noise instead of reflection

🎯 Desired outcome

RGB split stays expressive and clean

No visible “bounce” or mirrored artifacts

Feels intentional and premium, not accidental

2️⃣ Zoom Pulse Filter
⚠️ Current behavior

Zoom simply goes in → out → in → out

Motion feels:

repetitive

mechanical

disconnected from music structure

Lacks spatial complexity

❌ What’s not working

Zoom is not musically expressive

No directional variation

No relationship to bass/mid/high frequencies

Feels like a UI animation, not a visualizer

🔧 Recommended improvements (important)

This filter needs to become multi-axis and audio-driven.

1. Audio-reactive zoom

Bass: controls zoom intensity (push/pull)

Mid: controls zoom speed modulation

High: adds micro-jitters or sharp pulses

2. Add lateral motion (critical)

Introduce left/right and up/down drift

Subtle parallax movement tied to mids

Occasional diagonal movement for organic feel

3. Break the symmetry

Avoid perfect back-and-forth loops

Add:

easing curves

phase offsets

random micro-variation synced to beat

4. Optional enhancements

Slight rotation during zoom

Zoom toward a dynamic focal point (not always center)

🎯 Desired outcome

Zoom feels alive and musical

Motion reacts to rhythm, not a timer

Viewer feels “pulled into” the image instead of watching it bounce

3️⃣ Wave Distort Filter
✅ What’s working well

Overall concept is strong

Wave distortion feels psychedelic and fluid

Pairs well with atmospheric / trance tracks

Good base for a “liquid / smoke” aesthetic

⚠️ Issue observed

Wave amplitude is too strong

Image readability is reduced

Distortion dominates instead of enhancing

🔧 Recommended improvements

Reduce wave intensity

Lower amplitude

Keep motion subtle and continuous

Frequency tuning

Slower, broader waves

Less aggressive oscillation

Increase smoke / fog effect

Add:

volumetric softness

blurred displacement layers

alpha-based noise overlays

Audio mapping

Bass → subtle wave depth

Mid → wave flow speed

High → smoke shimmer / texture movement

🎯 Desired outcome

Dreamy, immersive distortion

Wave supports the image instead of overpowering it

Smoke becomes the dominant mood element

🔄 Summary of Key Action Items
Filter	Priority Fix
RGB Split	Remove mirrored background artifacts
Zoom Pulse	Make it audio-reactive + multi-directional
Wave Distort	Reduce wave strength, boost smoke
🧠 Overall UX Insight

Effects are conceptually strong

The next level is musical intelligence, not more intensity

Directional motion + frequency mapping = premium feel

Removing technical artifacts will massively improve perceived quality
