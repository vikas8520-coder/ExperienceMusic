Love this step. This is where your idea turns from **vision → execution**.

Below is a **clear, founder-grade Feature Prioritization Matrix** followed by a **V1 → V3 Product Roadmap** that’s realistic, defensible, and *beats existing players by design*, not scope creep.

---

# 🧭 FEATURE PRIORITIZATION MATRIX

**Axes used**

* **Impact** → How much this differentiates you / delivers value
* **Effort** → Engineering + design + risk

### Priority Levels

* **P0 (Must-have)** → Core identity
* **P1 (High-value)** → Strong differentiation
* **P2 (Strategic)** → Category creation
* **P3 (Future)** → Expansion & moat

# 🚀 PRODUCT ROADMAP (V1 → V3)

This roadmap is **intentionally focused**. Each version has a *clear reason to exist*.

---

## 🟢 V1 — **Foundational Engine (MVP but powerful)**

> **Goal:**
> Prove that *audio-reactive visuals + exports* can feel premium, real-time, and intentional.

### 🎯 Target Users

* Psy / trance producers
* Indie artists
* Visual-first creators

### ✅ V1 Features

* Upload audio
* Real-time audio-reactive visuals
* GPU shaders (3–5 styles)
* Frequency-based motion
* One-click video export
* Web-first (no login required)

### 🧠 Tech Stack (suggested)

* Web Audio API
* Three.js / WebGL
* GLSL shaders
* Canvas / WebGPU-ready

### 🚦 Success Metric

* “This looks better than Specterr”
* Artists share exported visuals
* <10 seconds from upload → visuals

---

## 🔵 V2 — **Artist Control + Healing Identity**

> **Goal:**
> Shift from *visualizer* → **intentional experience engine**

### 🎯 Target Users

* Conscious music artists
* Meditation / psych creators
* Healing facilitators

### ✅ V2 Features

* Artist-defined visual presets
* BPM detection
* Frequency → color → emotion mapping
* Mood modes:

  * Calm
  * Trance
  * Elevate
* Touch-based interaction (mobile/web)
* Save & reuse presets

### 🧠 Key Shift

From:

> “Look at this visual”

To:

> **“Feel this experience”**

### 🚦 Success Metric

* Same track looks different across modes
* Artists describe visuals as “intentional”

---

## 🟣 V3 — **Conscious Audio Platform**

> **Goal:**
> Create a **new category** competitors cannot copy easily.

### 🎯 Target Users

* Psych communities
* Wellness apps
* Artists + listeners
* Installations / events

### ✅ V3 Features

* Listener personalization
* Chakra-based visual layers
* Breath-synced motion pacing
* Mobile haptics synced to bass
* AI style generator
* Artist → listener interaction layer

### 🧠 This is where you become:

> “Apple of psych music experiences”

### 🚦 Success Metric

* Users say: *“This feels different every time”*
* Used for both listening & healing
* Platform, not a tool

---

## 🧩 ONE CRITICAL STRATEGIC RULE (IMPORTANT)

🚫 **Do NOT chase AI first**
✅ **Build deterministic audio → visual mapping first**

Why?

* Predictability builds trust
* Healing requires consistency
* AI comes later as *style*, not *structure*

---

## 🧠 Your Unfair Advantage

Others optimize for:

> speed, templates, virality

You optimize for:

> **intention, frequency, embodiment**

That’s not a feature — that’s a philosophy.

---

If you want next, I can:

* Turn this into a **PRD**
* Create a **pitch slide (1-page visual roadmap)**
* Define **core visual primitives (your design language)**
* Help you name **V1 publicly without saying “visualizer”**

Just tell me the next move 🚀
