Redesign the Presets Panel UI so every “function” tile/button is the same size to optimize space.

Context:
- This is a React + R3F music visualizer app.
- Presets panel shows categories (Base / Cymatics / Psy Shaders / Fractals) and each preset is a clickable control.
- Currently tiles vary in size and waste space; I want a premium, compact, consistent grid.

Requirements:
1) All preset tiles must be identical size (same width + height).
   - Desktop: fixed square tile size (e.g., 56–72px) with consistent padding.
   - Mobile: responsive tile size using grid auto-fit, but still uniform.

2) Use a grid layout that packs efficiently:
   - Desktop: grid with 4–6 columns depending on panel width.
   - Use CSS Grid: `grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fill, minmax(TILE_SIZE, 1fr))`
   - Fixed tile aspect ratio: `aspect-ratio: 1 / 1` (or explicit height).
   - Consistent gap (8–12px).

3) Tile content rules (must fit inside without changing tile size):
   - Icon centered top.
   - Preset name below, max 2 lines, truncation/ellipsis if needed.
   - Optional “selected” state ring/glow but MUST NOT change tile size or layout.

4) Interaction states:
   - Default, hover, pressed, selected, disabled.
   - Selected: clear highlight (border or glow), plus subtle background tint.
   - Hover: lift or brightness increase.
   - Pressed: slight scale down (e.g., 0.98) without shifting layout.

5) Category handling:
   - Group headings stay full width.
   - Each group uses the same uniform tile grid.
   - If groups are collapsible, the grid reflows smoothly.

6) Performance + UX:
   - Panel scrolls vertically; grid should not cause layout jumps.
   - Avoid long labels causing tile height changes—always fixed tile size.
   - Use virtualization if tile count becomes large (optional).

Deliverables:
- Provide Figma layout rules (Auto Layout + grid + spacing tokens).
- Provide React/Tailwind or CSS implementation for:
  - `PresetGrid`
  - `PresetTile` component (uniform sizing)
  - text truncation + icon sizing
  - selected/hover/pressed styles that don’t change layout
- Ensure the solution is “premium”: clean alignment, consistent rhythm, no wasted space.
