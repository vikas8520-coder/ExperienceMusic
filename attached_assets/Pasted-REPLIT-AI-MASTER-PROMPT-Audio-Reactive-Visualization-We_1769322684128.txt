REPLIT AI MASTER PROMPT

(Audio-Reactive Visualization Web App)

Role:
You are a senior creative-coding engineer and product engineer.

Goal:
Build a production-ready web app that allows users to upload an audio track and generates real-time, high-quality, audio-reactive visualizations in the browser.

Core Requirements:

Create a React + Vite web app (no Next.js).

Use Web Audio API to analyze uploaded audio files (mp3, wav, ogg).

Extract frequency bands (bass, mid, high) and overall energy in real time.

Render visuals using Three.js (WebGL), not 2D canvas.

Visuals must respond differently to:

Bass → scale / expansion

Mid → rotation / deformation

High → brightness / particle activity

Implement 3 visual presets:

“Energy Rings”

“Psy Tunnel”

“Particle Field”

Add UI controls:

Upload audio

Play / pause

Intensity slider

Motion speed slider

Color palette selector

Preset selector

Use GPU shaders (GLSL) where appropriate for smooth psychedelic motion.

Ensure visuals run at 60 FPS on modern browsers.

Export Requirement:
Add a basic record/export feature that records the Three.js canvas and audio together and downloads a WebM video.

UX Requirements:

Minimal, dark UI

Full-screen visuals

Instant feedback after upload

Clean component structure

Code Quality:

Modular components

Clear comments

No placeholder logic

Avoid deprecated APIs

Deliverables:

Full project file structure

Working code for audio analysis

Three.js visual engine

UI controls

Recording logic

Instructions to run locally

Do NOT:

Use external visualizer libraries

Use template generators

Hardcode fake animations

Outcome:
A real audio-reactive visualization engine suitable as V1 of a next-gen music visualization platform.

🧠 OPTIONAL FOLLOW-UP PROMPTS (USE AFTER FIRST BUILD)
🎛️ Improve Visual Quality
Refactor the visuals to use custom GLSL shaders for smoother psychedelic motion. Increase depth, glow, and fluidity.

🧘 Healing Mode (V2)
Add a "Healing Mode" where BPM controls slow breathing-like expansion and colors shift smoothly based on low-frequency dominance.

📱 Mobile Optimization
Optimize the Three.js renderer for mobile performance and add touch-based interaction.

⚠️ IMPORTANT TIP (REALITY CHECK)

Replit AI may:

Get audio analysis right

Get Three.js basics right

Need 1–2 refinement passes for shaders & performance

That’s normal.

Use:

Replit AI → structure + logic

Cursor → shader polish

Your vision → final tuning
