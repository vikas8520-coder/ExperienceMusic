Cool — here’s a polished bug report tailored for a web app / desktop web app context, plus the most likely root cause in that environment.

Bug Report: UI becomes non-interactive during music playback (artwork upload, dropdowns, scrolling)

Title

UI controls fail during music playback: cannot change artwork; dropdowns/scrolling/color changes unresponsive

Environment
	•	Platform: Web app (desktop browser)
	•	Browser: Brave
	•	OS: (macOS
	•	Build/version: (if available)
	•	Repro frequency: (Always 

Preconditions
	•	User is on a screen where artwork upload + customization controls are available.
	•	A track is available to play (music playback feature enabled).

⸻

Issue Summary

When music playback is active, multiple UI interactions stop working:
	•	Artwork can be uploaded when music is not playing (except thumbnail), and works as expected.
	•	When music is playing, artwork cannot be changed/uploaded.
	•	While music is playing, dropdowns and scrolling don’t work, so color changes (and other dropdown-driven options) can’t be applied.

This suggests playback mode is preventing pointer/scroll events from reaching the UI.

⸻

Steps to Reproduce

A) Artwork change blocked during playback
	1.	Open the app in desktop browser.
	2.	Navigate to the artwork upload/change section.
	3.	Start music playback.
	4.	Attempt to upload or change artwork (including thumbnail).

Expected: Artwork can be changed during playback, or UI clearly shows it is disabled with a message.
Actual: Artwork cannot be changed/uploaded while music is playing.

B) Dropdowns / scrolling blocked during playback
	1.	Start music playback.
	2.	Try opening a dropdown (example: color selection).
	3.	Try scrolling within the page and/or within dropdown lists.

Expected: Dropdown opens; scrolling works; option selections apply normally.
Actual: Dropdown/scrolling interactions do not respond while music is playing.

⸻

Additional Note: Thumbnail Upload
	•	Main artwork upload works as expected when not playing.
	•	Thumbnail upload does not work as expected (unclear if always or only during playback).

Need to capture: What exactly happens with thumbnail upload?
	•	Button disabled? Nothing happens? Error message? Upload succeeds but doesn’t display?

⸻

Impact
	•	Prevents users from editing artwork and appearance settings during playback.
	•	Makes key UI controls feel broken/unresponsive.
	•	Blocks testing and normal workflow if users want to preview while music plays.

Severity / Priority
	•	Severity: High (core editing workflow blocked)
	•	Priority: P1 / P2 depending on how central “edit while playing” is to expected behavior

Likely Root Cause (Web/Desktop)

Most likely one of these:

1) Playback overlay/canvas is covering the UI and capturing pointer events

Common in audio visualizer / interactive modes:
	•	A full-screen <canvas> or overlay div sits above the UI (higher z-index)
	•	It captures clicks/scrolls (because pointer-events is enabled)

Symptoms match exactly: clicks, dropdowns, scrolling stop working only during playback.

Fix pattern: ensure overlay layer uses:
	•	pointer-events: none; (if it shouldn’t block UI)
	•	or reduce z-index / confine overlay to its container

2) Global event listeners during playback are preventing default scrolling/click behavior

Playback mode might add:
	•	wheel, touchmove, keydown handlers with event.preventDefault()

This will break:
	•	scrolling
	•	dropdown scrolling
	•	some click interactions

3) Main-thread performance lock (visualizer too heavy)

If playback/visualization runs heavy JS on the main thread:
	•	UI becomes sluggish or appears “dead”
	•	Dropdown animations and file picker triggers can fail

⸻

Quick Dev Verification Steps
	•	Inspect DOM while playing: is a canvas/overlay positioned over the UI?
	•	Check computed CSS: z-index, position: fixed/absolute, pointer-events
	•	Temporarily toggle overlay pointer-events: none and retest
	•	Check event listeners added on play (wheel/touchmove/mousedown)
	•	Performance profiler: look for “Long Tasks” during playback

⸻

Suggested Fix / Acceptance Criteria
	•	User can interact with dropdowns and scroll normally while music is playing.
	•	User can change/upload artwork during playback OR the UI explicitly disables it with a clear message.
	•	Thumbnail upload works consistently with main artwork upload (or is clearly documented/disabled).
