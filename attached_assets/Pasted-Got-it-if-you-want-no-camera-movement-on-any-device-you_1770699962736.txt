Got it — if you want **no camera movement on any device**, you’ll get a big stability win because you eliminate the worst “interactive” case. Here’s the clean way to do it **without making Mandelbulb feel dead**.

## What “remove camera movement” should mean (in your app)

* Disable **OrbitControls** and **FlyControls**
* Lock camera position + rotation (or keep a fixed rotation)
* Keep Mandelbulb as a **Cinematic preset**:

  * audio/beat drives the animation
  * user can still change *look* via sliders (safe)
  * optional: “new viewpoint” button (instant or eased) but not continuous movement

---

# 1) Disable camera controls in this preset

### Remove these from Mandelbulb preset view

* `<OrbitControls />`
* Fly hook bindings / pointer lock

If you currently mount them conditionally by preset:

```tsx
{activePreset === "mandelbulb" ? null : <OrbitControls ... />}
```

Or inside the Mandelbulb component:

```tsx
// Do NOT render OrbitControls in Mandelbulb view
```

---

# 2) Freeze camera transform (hard lock)

In `useFrame`, force camera to fixed values:

```ts
const FIXED_POS = new THREE.Vector3(0, 0, 15);
const FIXED_QUAT = new THREE.Quaternion().setFromEuler(new THREE.Euler(0, 0, 0));

useFrame(() => {
  camera.position.copy(FIXED_POS);
  camera.quaternion.copy(FIXED_QUAT);
  camera.updateMatrixWorld();
});
```

(If you already pass `u_camPos/u_camRot` uniforms from the camera, they’ll now stay stable.)

---

# 3) Replace “navigation” with safe cinematic controls (recommended)

Add a small panel for Mandelbulb only:

### Safe controls (no movement)

* **Zoom (fractal scale)**: changes `u_scale` (NOT camera)
* **Rotate (fractal rotation)**: rotate the **fractal space** in shader using a uniform `u_fractalRot`
* **Depth / Detail**: steps + iterations
* **Lighting**: glow/bloom amount
* **Beat impact**: beat → morph intensity

These are much cheaper than moving the camera because you can keep quality stable and avoid motion spikes.

---

# 4) Make the fractal “feel alive” without camera movement

Use beat + time to animate:

* fractal “power” wobble (small)
* glow pulse
* color cycling
* subtle domain warp

Example:

```glsl
float pw = u_power + u_beat * 0.4 + 0.15 * sin(u_time * 0.6);
```

---

# 5) Apply the necessary performance changes (since camera is locked)

Even with static camera, shading can still be heavy. Do these:

### A) Replace normal method + remove curvature normal

* Use **tetra normal (4 map calls)**
* Remove second normal call for curvature

### B) Disable soft shadows permanently (or keep very light)

If you want max smoothness across devices:

* Shadows **OFF**
  or
* shadows with **8 steps max** only

### C) Reduce AO samples

Use **2 samples** (or OFF). AO is expensive and less noticeable with good lighting.

### D) Keep DPR override for Mandelbulb

Keep:

* renderer DPR = **1.0** for Mandelbulb (always)

---

# 6) Concrete “Cinematic Mandelbulb” defaults (smooth)

Use these as hard defaults:

* DPR (Mandelbulb): **1.0**
* Steps: **90**
* Iterations: **9**
* AO: **OFF** (or 2-sample)
* Shadows: **OFF**
* Normal: tetra (4 map)
* Bloom: ON but subtle (or lower-res bloom)

This will be smooth on Mac/Windows and “acceptable” on many mobiles.

---

# 7) Optional: “New viewpoint” button (no continuous movement)

If you still want exploration:

* Provide 4–6 preset viewpoints (preselected camera positions or fractal offsets)
* When user clicks, **ease** to it over 1 second, then stop

That’s not “movement” in control sense — it’s a controlled transition.

---

## If you paste your Mandelbulb preset component file, I can rewrite the exact sections

But if you want to do it right now: tell me which you prefer:

1. **Pure static** (no viewpoint changes at all)
2. **Static + viewpoint buttons** (still no orbit/fly)

Either way, the steps above are the “necessary changes” to keep it smooth and premium.
